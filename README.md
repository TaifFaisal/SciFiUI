# Description of the assignment
This assignment is about creating a user interface for a science fiction idea using java and processing. The purpose behind this assignment is to practice what I have leaned and to improve my coding skills plus getting the chance to use git. I struggled in the beginning to find an idea for my assignment, as science fiction is not one of my strongest points. However, I had a chat with a couple of friends who are fans of science fiction movies and games. They inspired me to come up with the idea of a spaceship. 

# Instructions
The user must press enter to start the program, the main page will then be displayed. The main page will contain 3 buttons. First, an info button which will display some information. Second, an exit button this button will ask the user to confirm their choice of exiting the program. If the user chose either the info or the exit button a return button will be displayed in case the user wants to go back to the main page. Third, a start button to show the spaceship from inside, inside the spaceship there are a lot of different buttons, however none of them (except the exit button) will work unless the start button is clicked. After clicking the start button the user can click any button, such as:

• Radar : displays the radar.

• Clock : shows a digital clock.

• Bar chart : shows a bar chart.

• Fire on : If the user clicked on the fire on button extra information will be displayed on the screen, and diamonds will       appear on the background, after collecting a specific amount of diamonds the user’s level will be increased, as well as       displaying a sound effect, there is also an extra button in case the user can’t find any diamonds.

• Fire off : stop the diamonds from appearing and it will get rid of the extra information on the screen.

• Spaceship speed : speed the background.

• Information button : sound effect.

• Help button: an emergency sound effect.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
