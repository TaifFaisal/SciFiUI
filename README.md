# Description of the assignment
This assignment is about creating a user interface for a science fiction idea using java and processing. The purpose behind this assignment is to practice what I have leaned and to improve my coding skills plus getting the chance to use git. I struggled in the beginning to find an idea for my assignment, as science fiction is not one of my strongest points. However, I had a chat with a couple of friends who are fans of science fiction movies and games. They inspired me to come up with the idea of a spaceship.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
